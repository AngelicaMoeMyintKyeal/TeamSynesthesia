## About The Project

Amotus vessel is a game born from the idea of telling a story about emotions. The project aims to show how emotions aren't just something that "happen" to us, but something people can use as energy to act. From this, we thought about making emotions an active element of gameplay.

## Game Name
`
Amotus Vessel
`

## Game Description

Amotus Vessel is an action platformer with speedrun components. The player will be able to explore different environments (related to core emotions and randomly placed on the map), where our protagonist will encounter unique enemies and, by defeating them, obtain a damage boost, that resets if they take a hit. The goal of the game is to find the boss room and do this in the shortest amount of time possible, to be the fastest player and set the best time.
